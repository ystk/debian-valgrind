 OpenMP stands for <emphasis>Open Multi-Processing</emphasis>. The OpenMP
 standard consists of a set of compiler directives for C, C++ and Fortran
 programs that allows a compiler to transform a sequential program into a
-parallel program. OpenMP is well suited for HPC applications and allows to
+parallel program. OpenMP is well suited for HPC applications and allows one to
 work at a higher level compared to direct use of the POSIX threads API. While
 OpenMP ensures that the POSIX API is used correctly, OpenMP programs can still
 contain data races. So it definitely makes sense to verify OpenMP programs
