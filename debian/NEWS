valgrind (1:3.7.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  Valgrind symbols have been stripped since version 1:3.6.1-5 because they take
  a lot of disk space (cf. #475562). This is not supported by upstream, who
  recommends to not do so because it may cause problems (e.g. unhelpful error
  messages).

  From now on, the stripped symbols will be provided in the valgrind-dbg
  package, which is a compromise of both "use cases" (who wants to avoid
  problems installs the -dbg package, who wants to save disk space doesn't).

valgrind (1:3.6.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this version /usr/lib/valgrind binaries are stripped which
  saves about 150Mb on amd64 for example.

  It's supposed to be unsupported according to valgrind packaging
  instructions[0]. Though preliminary tests tends to show the way Debian
  strips symbols works.

  If you encounter issues with valgrind reports becoming useless try to revert
  to some version before 1:3.6.1-4 (for example from [1]). And if that fixes
  it, this stripping is likely to be the cause.
